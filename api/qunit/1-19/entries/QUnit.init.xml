		<p class="warning"><strong>Note:</strong> This method is DEPRECATED. Don't use it!</p>
		<p>This method will throw an error in 2.0, and will be removed in 2.1</p>
		<p>If the runner has already run, calling <code>QUnit.init()</code> will re-initialize the runner, effectively resetting it. This method does not need to be called in the normal use of QUnit.</p>
